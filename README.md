# Java_Full_Inheritance

This lab was done in my Java Programming Principles II class. It was centered around the use of inheritance. This was the first time that I had the opportunity to create and work on classes that extend super classes. It was also the first time that I created Interfaces that I could implement in my code. I am really proud of this assignment because it took a lot of effort to complete due to the amount of code involved.

The basic idea behind this lab is to scan a text file and create either a hockey, baseball, or football player by using their respective subclass. A Player object is then created and can be placed inside of an array in the Team class. The team class has methods such as calculateTaxes() and calculatePayroll() that implement their interfaces from the Interface Package.
At the end, the program prints out the information from the teamlist.txt file.
